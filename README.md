a javascript keylogger included in a gif file 
This is a PoC

The idea to inlcuding javascript in a .gif file came form Saumil Shah @therealsaumil 
(site:  http://www.net-square.com ) <br>
This technique he named "**IMAJS**" <br>
The asm file for this, came form  Ange Albertini @angealbertin ( site: http://code.google.com/p/corkami/ )

**only** for tests
